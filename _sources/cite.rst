      abstract     = {We present a practical white-light interferometric method, supported by an open-source Python library optifik for automated spectrum-to-thickness deduction, enabling foam film measurements down to a few nanometers. We describe three typical spectral scenarii encountered in this method: spectra exhibiting numerous interference fringes, spectra with a moderate number of peaks, and spectra with only a few identifiable features, providing illustrative examples for each case. We also discuss the main limitations of the technique, including spectral range constraints, the necessity of knowing the refractive index, and the influence of spectral resolution and signal quality. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the method in a time-resolved study of a TTAB (tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide) foam film undergoing elongation and thinning. This method can be adapted to measure any thin non-opaque layer.},
